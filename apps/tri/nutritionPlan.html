    <h1>Ironman Race Strategy, Nutrition Plan, and Gear Checklist</h1>

    <h2>Race Strategy</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Swim:</strong> Start conservatively, especially if you're nervous or the swim start is crowded. Find your rhythm, stay relaxed, and focus on smooth, efficient strokes. Drafting behind another swimmer can save energy.</li>
        <li><strong>Bike:</strong> Keep your effort steady and controlled. Aim for a consistent power output or heart rate. Avoid pushing too hard on the bike, as you need to save energy for the marathon. Remember to take advantage of aid stations.</li>
        <li><strong>Run:</strong> Begin the marathon at a comfortable pace. The first half should feel manageable. If you're feeling good after 13 miles, you can start to increase the pace slightly. Focus on maintaining good form and staying mentally strong.</li>
        <li><strong>Pacing:</strong> Stick to your race plan and avoid the temptation to go too fast, especially early on. Use a pacing device (watch, heart rate monitor) to stay within your planned effort levels.</li>
        <li><strong>Mental Strategy:</strong> Break the race into manageable segments. Focus on one discipline at a time and set small goals, like reaching the next aid station. Stay positive and adjust your plan as needed based on how you feel.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Nutrition Plan</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Pre-Race:</strong> Eat a carbohydrate-rich breakfast 3-4 hours before the start (e.g., oatmeal with banana, toast with jam, sports drink). Avoid high-fat and high-fiber foods that can cause digestive issues.</li>
        <li><strong>Swim:</strong> Hydrate well before the swim start. Some athletes take an energy gel with water 15 minutes before the start.</li>
        <li><strong>Bike:</strong> Aim to consume 200-300 calories per hour, primarily from easily digestible carbohydrates (e.g., energy gels, bars, sports drinks). Drink water regularly and use electrolyte supplements as needed, especially in hot conditions.</li>
        <li><strong>Run:</strong> Continue to take in 150-250 calories per hour, focusing on gels, chews, and sports drinks. Sip water at aid stations and stay aware of your hydration status. Adjust your intake based on how you feel.</li>
        <li><strong>Hydration:</strong> Stay ahead of dehydration by drinking regularly throughout the race. Consider alternating between water and sports drinks to maintain electrolyte balance. Monitor urine color (light yellow is ideal) as an indicator of hydration.</li>
    </ul>
